# Fundamentals of Deep Learning - TensorFlow v1.2.x porting

This is a port of sample code at https://github.com/darksigma/Fundamentals-of-Deep-Learning-Book to TensorFlow v1.2.x. The author of "Fundamentals of Deep Learning" wrote TensorFlow code on TF 1.0 or 1.1 and hopefully some trivial renaming of API calls will work. I have already ported CNN related scripts (conv*.py and cifar10_input.py) when I created this repo. I want to keep track of the latest port here and happy to share with any one reading the same book.
